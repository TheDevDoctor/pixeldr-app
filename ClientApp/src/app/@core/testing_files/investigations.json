The ACMI hysteroscope was then introduced into the uterine cavity using sterile saline solution as a distending media and with attached video camera. The endometrial cavity was distended with fluids and the cavity visualized. No abnormailites were noted within the uterine cavity. The coronal areas were visualized bilaterally with corresponding tubal ostia. No proliferative endometrium was noted. There were no direct intraluminal lesions seen. The patient tolerated the procedure well. Several pictures were taken of the endometrial cavity and the hysteroscope removed from the cavity.\n\nA large sharp curet was then used to obtain a moderate amount of tissue, which was the sent to pathologist for analysis.

The green filter was used at this stage of the examination to observe the vascular patterns. A 3 to 5% acetic acid solution was applied to the cervix to visualize the acetowhite reaction, which occurs when the squamous epithelium is abnormal. Complete colposcopic examination was done observing the original squamous epithelium, the entire transformation zone, the squamocolumnar junction and as much of the columnar epithelium of the cervix. No abnormal findings are noted on the cervix. Application of Lugol’s iodine causes a homogeneous dark brown staining of normal squamous epithelium; iodine non-reactive epithelium was noted. Biopsies are performed under colposcopic guidance after precisely localizing the abnormal areas using acetic acid and iodine tests.
